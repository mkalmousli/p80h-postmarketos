# Status / bring-up log

Hypothesis -> test -> result. One change per run.

- Critical PLL/mux prepared while running stalls the bus -> ARMPLL removed, mux CRITICAL dropped -> boots to initramfs.
- Preparing any PLL LK already runs (univpll) stalls -> apmixed prepare skips PLLs that are already on -> USB clocks enable fine.
- PHY register read at 0x11210800+0x6b works; writes under test (kernel-20 logs every write).
- Open: pwrap/PMIC probe stalls (disabled), mmc0 untested.
